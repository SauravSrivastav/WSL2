# WSL2- Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)

> WSL2 is part of Windows 10, version 2004 which was released in May 2020. Rather than using a translation or compatibility layer between Linux and Windows which was used in WSL 1, WSL 2 uses virtual machine technology to allow you to run a real Linux kernel directly on Windows 10. This also allows you to run Docker within Ubuntu running on Windows 10.
